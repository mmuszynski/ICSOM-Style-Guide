## Purpose

This repository is designed to establish a style guide to standardize style choices for publications of the International Conference of Symphony and Opera Musicians (ICSOM). While *Senza Sordino* is the primary focus of this guide, the choices here can be applied to any writings of the organization in order to provide a standard style across the organization's written content.

In general, ICSOM adopts the style as described in the [*Chicago Manual of Style*](https://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/home.html), and any style choices that are not described in this document should conform to the most recent version of CMS.

## General Considerations

Publications should always be presented in italics, including *Senza Sordino*.

## Corrections

Corrections should describe the error, along with the article name, as well as a description of the issue. The author should be noted if possible.

>In an article titled *Remembering Michael Morgan* in the December 2021 issue of *Senza Sordino*, a quote attributed to Kelly Hall-Tompkins incorrectly spelled her name as Kelly Hall-Thompkins. We regret the error.

## Music-specific Rules

When describing musicians with their titles, refer to the musicians, not their instruments. Capitalize portions of the position that are tiles (such as Principal, Asssitant Principal, Second, Third, etc), but do not capitalize the instrument portion of the position.

Note the use of irregular names for instrumentalists such as *flutist* and *trumpeter* as well as odd sounding ones like *hornist* (despite the fact that these words may be awkward, they are still more correct than labeling someone as an instrument).

> Preferred
> 
> Second bassoonist Mike Muszynski

> Discouraged
> 
> Second bassoon Mike Muszynski
> 
> Second Bassoonist Mike Muszynski

When referring specifically to a position, it is appropriate to refer to the instrument, rather than the person filling it.

>For the entire 2012-13 season, the position of Second Bassoon was vacant.
