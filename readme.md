## Purpose

This repository is designed to establish a style guide to standardize style choices for publications of the International Conference of Symphony and Opera Musicians (ICSOM). While *Senza Sordino* is the primary focus of this guide, the choices here can be applied to any writings of the organization in order to provide a standard style across the organization's written content.

In general, ICSOM adopts the style as described in the [*Chicago Manual of Style*](https://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/home.html), and any style choices that are not described in this document should conform to the most recent version of CMS.

## General Considerations

Publications should always be presented in italics, including *Senza Sordino*.

## Corrections

Corrections should describe the error, along with the article name, as well as a description of the issue. The author should be noted if possible.

>In an article titled *Remembering Michael Morgan* in the December 2021 issue of *Senza Sordino*, a quote attributed to Kelly Hall-Tompkins incorrectly spelled her name as Kelly Hall-Thompkins. We regret the error.

## Music-specific Rules

When describing musicians with their titles, remember that the musician is a person, not an instrument. In keeping with the rules for titles, when using the instrument as part of a personal title, capitalize it, but do not capitalize when used elsewhere (CMOS 8.19).

> Preferred
> 
> Second Bassoonist Mike Muszynski

> Discouraged
> 
> Second Bassoon Mike Muszynski

When referring specifically to a position, it is appropriate to refer to the instrument, rather than the person filling it.

>For the entire 2012-13 season, the position of Second Bassoon was vacant.

Note one acception to this rule (CMOS 8.30) that generic titles should be kept lowercase.

> Indianapolis Symphony Orchestra bassoonist Mike Muszynski...

## Extra things that often get overlooked

Titles should only be capitalized where they are used as adjectives.

> ICSOM General Counsel Kevin Case
>
> Kevin Case, ICSOM general counsel

Generally write out United States when used as a noun and abbreviate with US as an adjective.

> The conference was held in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, a city in the United States
>
> The conference was held in a US locationâ€”Milwaukee, Wisconsin
