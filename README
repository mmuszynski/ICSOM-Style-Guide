#Purpose

This repository is designed to establish a style guide to standardize style choices for publications of the International Conference of Symphony and Opera Musicians (ICSOM). While *Senza Sordino* is the primary focus of this guide, the choices here can be applied to any writings of the organization in order to provide a standard style across the organization's written content.

In general, ICSOM adopts the style as described in the [*Chicago Manual of Style*](https://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/home.html), and any style choices that are not described in this document should conform to the most recent version of CMS.
