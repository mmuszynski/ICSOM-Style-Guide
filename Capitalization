## Capitalization

In general (following [CMOS 8.19](https://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/book/ed17/part2/ch08/psec019.html)), titles should only be capitalized where they are used as adjectives.

## Musician Titles

When describing musicians with their titles, remember that the musician is a person, not an instrument. In keeping with the rules for titles, when using the instrument as part of a personal title, capitalize it, but do not capitalize when used elsewhere.

> Preferred
> 
> Second Bassoonist Mike Muszynski

> Discouraged
> 
> Second Bassoon Mike Muszynski

When referring specifically to a position, it is appropriate to refer to the instrument, rather than the person filling it.

>For the entire 2012-13 season, the position of Second Bassoon was vacant.

Note the following acception to this rule ([CMOS 8.30](https://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/book/ed17/part2/ch08/psec030.html)): generic titles, such as occupational roles, should be kept lowercase.
