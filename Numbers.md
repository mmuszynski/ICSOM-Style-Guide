# Numbers

For spelling out numbers, use the alternate rule (CMOS 9.3):

[Spell] out only single-digit numbers and [use] numerals for all others ...

> There are 51 member orchestras in ICSOM.
>
> Only four of these orchestras were furloughed during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Continue to follow other rules for spelling out numbers in the CMOS.
