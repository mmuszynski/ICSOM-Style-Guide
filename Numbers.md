# Numbers

*This advice is no longer current as of September 2023.*

~~For spelling out numbers, use the alternate rule (CMOS 9.3):

[Spell] out only single-digit numbers and [use] numerals for all others ...

> There are 51 member orchestras in ICSOM.
>
> Only four of these orchestras were furloughed during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Continue to follow other rules for spelling out numbers in the CMOS.~~

## Telephone Numbers

When including US-based telephone numbers, use the alternate rule (CMOS 9.57):

An alternative style, which recognizes the increasing need to use the area code even for local calls, drops the parentheses.

> e.g. 904-555-1234 is preferred over (904) 555-1234
