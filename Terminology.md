## Terminology

Some terminology used in editing can be confusing. What's a restrictive clause?

## Restrictive and Nonrestrictive Clauses

A restrictive clause identifies the word it modifies. Its inclusion is essential to the word's definition

> The candidate _who receives the most votes_ will be elected president.

In this case, the candidate is identified by the clause "who receives the most votes."

The opposite of a restrictive clause is a nonrestrictive clause, which adds additional information that is not necessary to identify the object.

> Joe Biden, _the candidate who received the most votes_, was elected president.

Here, the fact that Joe Biden was elected president is evident, and adding that he was also the candidate who received the most votes is unnecessary for his identification. Note that the nonrestrictive clause is set off by commas.

> The candidate who received the most votes, _Joe Biden_, was elected president.

In this case, the nonrestrictive clause is now "Joe Biden", because the candidate is identified by the clause "who received the most votes", and Joe Biden adds extra information.

By far, the most common reason to know whether a clauses is restrictive or nonrestrictive occurs when using "that" or "which" to set off the clause (however, don't use either when referring to people—use "who" instead):

> The ballot that had the stray marks ended up in the spoiled ballots pile.
>
> The spoiled ballot, which had the stray marks, ended up in the spoiled ballots pile.

Restrictive clauses have also come up in musical titles, as an opus number can be used restrictively or nonrestrictively:

> **Restrictive**: Mozart's K. 191, a bassoon concerto in B-flat major...
>
> **Nonrestrictive**: Mozart's Bassoon Concerto in B-flat Major, K.191...

In the first case the Köchel number identifies the work, and in the second case
