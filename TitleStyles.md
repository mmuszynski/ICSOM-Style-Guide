## Title Styles

General rules for the styling of titles of works begins in [CMOS 8.157](https://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/book/ed17/part2/ch08/psec157.html). There are a lot of rules for titles, but some of the more common rules are listed in the section below.

## Common usage

Names of publications, such as *Senza Sordino* should always be presented in italics. Titles of articles should use roman text with quotation marks.

> In ICSOM President Paul Austin's report "An Honest Partnership" from the October 2023 issue of _Senza Sordino_, he discusses his working relationship with outgoing Chairperson Meredith Snow.

Musical works are generally italicized if they are large works such as operas. However, individual arias from operas are set in roman with quotation marks:

>the "Flower Duet" from _Lakmé_

>"Là ci darem la mano" from Mozart's _Don Giovanni_.

Other musical works with generic names are not italicized, but the descriptive names for them are.

> Mozart's Symphony no. 41 (_Jupiter_); the _Jupiter_ Symphony by Mozart

Opus numbers (including the special ones for *those* composers) should be set off with a comma unless they are restrictive:

> Mozart's Symphony no. 41, K. 551; Mozart's K. 551, the _Jupiter_ Symphony
